# Animal shelter

## Motivation

The idea of this project is to help with understanding and consolidate knowledge about different technologies used in programming. 

## About project

The project was created to learn and practice using these skills in a real platform with real problems. 

The `Animal shelter` is an application that focuses on simple operations in the beginning. In process of time will be developed and new functionalities will be added. 

The `Animal shelter` as the name suggests, stores data about animals and employees (zookeepers, doctors etc). 
Both animals and employees can be added, delete, update, read data, etc.
The animals will be associated with their keepers in such a way that each animal has a zookeeper to care for it.

In the future, we also want to introduce an animal clinic as a separate service so that animals that require medical care can receive it.

### Technologies
In this project, the following technologies will be used:
*Java 11, Spring, H2 database (in the beginning), Hibernate, Mockito, Junit, Maven.*

The technologies were chosen because of their wide use in the market.
